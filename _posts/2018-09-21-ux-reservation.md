When I come across a poorly designed website, especially one intended to be a web application, I die a little bit on the inside. Fortunately, it indicates some job security for me, but poor user experience irritates me. For a User Experience aand Interface Design class I was comissioned to find such a site, conduct user research, and propose a redesign to correct issues I found.

Part of the assignment was to document the research and redesign in a process book, shown here. I chose to redesign my University's external room reservation system, which was not only poorly branded and marketed, but also functionally failing. It was a great experience finding users to test the original site, the paper wireframes I created, and my final prototype. 

This design is available in a click through prototype on [InVision](https://invis.io/4YODOJ0NVWA#/279466722_login).
