When I started as a design student, I found that many serif fonts were unengaging and too traditional for my tastes. Since I was so unappreciative of them, I was a bit bummed when I found out that I was to create a poster about Adobe Garamond Pro for my Typography class. However, as I researched and exposed myself to this typeface, I grew a love for the classic look of some timeless serif fonts. 

I was assigned to create an engaging and informative poster detailing information about this typeface, without using any imagery. Only the typeface, flat color, and textures were allowed, which posed a challenge. After several iterations refining unity, variety, and hierarchy, this captivating result emerged. This project definitely contributed to my growing love for all things typography.
