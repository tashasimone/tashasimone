One of my favorite challenges in design is creating designs that are cohesive with existing branding. With this project, the client was looking for a brochure-style newsletter to update their donors and stakeholders on events, show how their contributions have been making an impact, and encourage donations. 

The national organization of Youth for Christ has specific regional branding, which this project had to be tailored to. I adopted the color palette and basic forms of the branding to maintain consistency. I was able to create a newsletter that they were supremely satisfied with, as well as a coordinating envelope for shipping.
