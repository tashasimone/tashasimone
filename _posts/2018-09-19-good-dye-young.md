Since 6th grade, I've been passionate about two things: colored hair and the band Paramore, fronted by Hayley Williams. These loves came together a few years ago when Hayley created her own hair dye line, called goodDYEyoung. I was instantly entralled, and when I was assigned to redesign a website for my Web Design 2 class, I knew exactly what challenge I wanted to take on. I used this redesign as a chance to become more familiar with creating custom WordPress themes, and experiment with some PHP. Since the audience and customer base is generally my peers, I adopted the idea of Polaroid prints to exhibit each product since those have come back into style lately. 

This site was designed to be responsive to a variety of screens. Since this was a class project, it is not hosted anywhere, but you can check out my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/tashasimone/good-dye-young)
