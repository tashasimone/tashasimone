In the summer of 2018 I was asked to redesign and customize a Squarespace website for a client. Having never used Squarespace before, I dove right in to learn the system and determine what level of customization was reasonable for this project. I worked with a graphic designer to rebrand Brittany and bring her vision to life. Learning to work with this system was very helpful, because in the future I can better understand how to offer clients a website that I can customize for them but they can easily keep updated, since Squarespace is user-friendly. 
With Brittany's rebrand, we focused on promoting her blog in order to drive public speaking bookings. It was important to include a way to subscribe to recieve new blog posts, as well as focus in on her preferred topics: motivation, motherhood, marriage, and missions.
