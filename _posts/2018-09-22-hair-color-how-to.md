Being a design student is wonderful because when you reach upper level courses you are given more freedom as to the content of your projects, as long as certain requirements are met. For this project in Production Design 1, I was asked to create a 7 x 9 inch folded how-to manual in a topic I am experienced in. Since I've dyed my hair myself dozens of times from the age of 13, I decided to pursue this as a topic. 

I recognized that many people are hesitant to dye their hair an unnatural color, at least partially because they are unsure if it will look "good". To help combat that fear and inspire people to just "go for it," I created this step-by-step manual to find a hair color that will suit you considering skin tone, seasons, and other factors. I laid out the content in InDesign, and took color samples for the design from one of my favorite hair dye companies.
