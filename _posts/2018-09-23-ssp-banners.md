        <p>Display marketing online is the most viewed form of advertising in current times, and it's an effective way for businesses to advertise services to potential customers. Sit Stay n' Play, an indoor dog park near Dayton, Ohio, wanted to increase awareness of their boarding services. To accomplish this, I created three eye-catching web banners that would be targeted to potential customers on relevant websites. With clear messaging, I emphasized a call to action to increase traffic to their website.</p>
        <p>After the success of the banner ads, the client asked me to design a <a href="https://www.sitstaynplaydogpark.com/training/">new page</a> on their website detailing their dog training offerings. With such a variety of classes and packages, it was a challenge to organize the relevant information on the page. I applied principles of hierarchy and clear messaging to help guide the user to the information they need.</p>
