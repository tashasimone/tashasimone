        <p>It's impossible to go through a design education without hearing of the legendary Paul Rand. While all designers have others they look up to, I especially admired his flexibility of design. In a class I was asked to research my favorite designer and give a biographical presentation to the class, as well as design a piece as an homage to the designer of choice.</p>
        <p>As an avid fan of logo design, my choice was clear. Paul Rand was such an unspeakably influential person in the field of design, and I strive to follow in his footsteps. In this piece I embraced the character of Rand by incoporating key elements: his thick-rimmed glasses, bars from the IBM logo, the colors from Sparkle and Spin, the angle of the NEXT logo, the typeface Futura, juxtaposed type, as well as one of his quotes with his signature. All of these elements speak to a different part in Rand's career, style, and personality, solidifying an concept of who this man was in a singular image.</p>
