Everyone loves a good story, and for many people visuals can make a tale even more memorable. A challenge many graphic designers face is communicating a story through only visuals. In my Graphic Design 2 class, I was challenged to do this with my favorite story. When I was a child, my dad read the Lord of the Rings books to my brother and I as bedtime stories. To this day, I still love the adventures of hobbits through Middle Earth, and have two tattoos to support this claim. 

Without much illustration experience, this project was a major challenge for me. I sought to communicate the vital components of Frodo and Sam's journey to Mount Doom, executed through composition and scale of elements.
