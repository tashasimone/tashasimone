I was always told to not judge a book by its cover, but in this world a boring book with an engaging cover is probably more likely to sell than an incredible book without imagery that sets it apart on the shelf. Penguin Random House publishers host a student design contest every year, and in 2018 the children's book to design a cover for was the young adult novel Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman. After reading the premise of the book, I immediately started coming up with ideas on how to bring some of the themes in the book into a visual form.

The book is about a racist dystopia, which I alluded to with the color, or lack thereof of my design. I also foreshadowed the ending of the book through the noose illustration, while also representing the nought and cross referred to in the title. This cover was a great learning experience in design, and prompted me to seek out balances between minimal and dynamic designs.
