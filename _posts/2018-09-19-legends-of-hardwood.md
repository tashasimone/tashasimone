        <p>As an intern for a small marketing company, I learned quickly how to balance client wants with good design. This project gave me great experience with revision and feedback. Since this project was for a non-profit, a major goal was to keep costs low. This limited us to a half sheet piece compared to the trifold full sheet from the previous year.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the smaller size of the piece, there was still a lot of information that had to be included. This was a great challenge for me to fit all the given content on the page without making it feel over crowded by establishing hierarchy and flow.</p>
