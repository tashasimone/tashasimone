        <p>Since my sophomore year of high school I have been aware of the human trafficking crisis that plagues not only the United States, but the entire world. Mission 108 is a non-profit that works in awareness, prevention, and recovery of human trafficking. When they were seeking to launch a massive fundraising campaign, I was excited to work on such a vital project. To effectively collect donations and administrate the campaign, Mission 108 chose to use the Funraise platform.</p>
        <p>Without prior experience using Funraise, I jumped right in to address customization options to effectively communicate thier mission and vision. While the basic framework for the site was generated, I was responsible to make it informative and cohesive with the overall branding of the campaign. To support this, I also customized MailChimp templates and created social media graphics to promote the campaign and raise awareness for human trafficking.</p>
        <p>This site is live at <a href="https://donate.mission108.com/">donate.mission108.com</a>.</p>
