        <p>One of my most memorable college experiences was working in the scene shop of the theater department. The plethora of sawdust I came into contact with inspired my execution of this project. In Production Design 1 class I was assigned to find or create my own alphabet, which I did in the shop.</p>
        <p>At first I used a few different approaches, but after some critque from peers I went with the letters created in negative space of unique piles of sawdust. I then had to do some color correction of the images, and assemble them into a poster. The next part of the assignment was to create a die-cut document in InDesign and arrange letters on it. The die cut was created to allow the box to be folded flat to be shippable, but with a rubber band inside to make it pop up upon opening.</p>
