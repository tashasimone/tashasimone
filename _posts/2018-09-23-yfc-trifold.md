        <p>One of my favorite challenges in design is creating designs that are cohesive with existing branding. With this project, the client was looking for a brochure-style newsletter to update their donors and stakeholders on events, show how their contributions have been making an impact, and encourage donations.</p>
        <p>The national organization of Youth for Christ has specific regional branding, which this project had to be tailored to. I adopted the color palette and basic forms of the branding to maintain consistency. I was able to create a newsletter that they were supremely satisfied with, as well as a coordinating envelope for shipping.</p>
