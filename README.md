# portfolio site // learning jekyll
This project kills two birds with one stone for me: it serves as my personal design portfolio, and it taught me how to use jekyll. I'm currently open to job opportunities, so if you like what you see, please reach out! Or if you have constructive criticism, send it my way because I thrive on it.
