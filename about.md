# hey! i'm tasha simone

I'm a native Californian who transplanted herself to small town Ohio to study design. After graduation, I headed back to California but this time 400 miles north. My ideas of fun include handlettering, gardening, hiking, making vegan food, and getting tattoos. I started my design journey at the age of 11, making forum signature banners in picnik and gimp, and thinking my garish use of blending modes was the height of graphic design. If you ask nicely, I might even show you some of my earliest, albeit cringe worthy works. I have since dabbled in computer science, dyed my hair 54 times, and completed a triathlon. 

My passion for good design and user interaction stems from teaching my grandma how to use her computer. In helping her, I recognized that each person interacts with technology in their own way, but that good and accessible design can prevent needless frustration. Beyond interactive design, I am passionate about typography, and can spend hours on typekit appreciating typefaces and theorizing about projects they would perfectly complement. I have yet to fully realize a typeface of my own, but hope to someday.

While you're here, check out my work and let me know what your favorite pizza topping is.
