# about tasha simone

I'm a california girl living in a lonely world. my ideas of fun include naps and hikes, netflix binges and bike rides, taco bell runs and making vegan food. I started my designer journey at the age of 10, making forum signature banners in picnik and gimp, and thinking my garish use of blending modes was the height of graphic design. I have since dabbled in computer science, dyed my hair 47 times, and completed a triathlon. 

My passion for good design and user interaction stems from teaching my grandma how to use her computer. I recognized that each person interacts with technology in their own way, but that good design can prevent frustration. Beyond interactive design, I am passionate about typography, and can spend hours on typekit appreciating typefaces and theorizing about projects they would perfectly complement.
