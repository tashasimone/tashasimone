## hey! i'm tasha simone

I'm a California girl who transplanted herself to small town Ohio to study design before somehow heading back to California after graduation, but this time 7 hours north. My ideas of fun include  Netflix binges, bike rides, Taco Bell runs, making vegan food, and getting tattoos. I started my designer journey at the age of 10, making forum signature banners in Picik and GIMP, and thinking my garish use of blending modes was the height of graphic design. If you ask nicely, I might even show you some of my earliest, albeit cringe worthy works. I have since dabbled in computer science, dyed my hair 47 times, and completed a triathlon. 

My passion for good design and user interaction stems from teaching my grandma how to use her computer. I recognized that each person interacts with technology in their own way, but that good design can prevent frustration. Beyond interactive design, I am passionate about typography, and can spend hours on typekit appreciating typefaces and theorizing about projects they would perfectly complement. I have yet to fully realize a typeface of my own, but hope to do so by the end of 2019.

While you're here, check out my work and let me know what your favorite pizza topping is.
